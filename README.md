# Problem Statement
In this  modern era of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to identify  traffic signs and  can alert the driver 
for upcoming traffic signs and  make decisions accordingly.

 # About the Python Project 
  In this project, we will make a deep neural network that will classify the traffic signs present in images into different categories. Through this model, we will be able to reduce  
  road accidents. Through this model, we can read the traffic signs, which is very important for self-driving autonomous  vehicles.

# Dataset for Python Project
For this project, we are using the public dataset available at Kaggle: Traffic Signs Dataset
This  dataset contains images  of more than 50000 which are classified into 43 different classes. The size of the dataset is around 300MB. The dataset contains a train  folder and a test folder which contains images each classes.
